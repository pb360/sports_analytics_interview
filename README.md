# sports_analytics_interview
This is an interview / assessment  for a sports analytics company


## Instructions

Attached here is a link to zip containing a data file containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and the associated metadata describing the data.

Please review the dataset and start outlining the way you would go about the model-building process with the goal of predicting the probability that the next thrown pitch will be a fastball, slider, change-up, etc.

We would like to see you assess the data, build a predictive model, and then evaluate that model and the success of its predictions,  with the understanding that delivering predictions with any degree of accuracy is unlikely in this short time span. Please provide any associated data analysis (plots, graphs, etc..), feature engineering, and code assembled in the form of a python notebook. Please include markup text to explain your analysis, graphs, etc. If you include a notebook, please also add an HTML version of that notebook, to facilitate review.

## Notes for other readers
To share on git, the file has been zipped into pitches.zip. 
To run the code, simply unzip it. The unzipped file should be simply named "pitches". This was specified for me. I would prefer it be named pitches.csv. 
Note, this data shared it publicly available data from the MLB, not from the company who administered this code test.
